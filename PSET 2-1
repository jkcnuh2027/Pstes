# Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

# The following variables contain values as described below:

# balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card

# annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

# monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal


for i in range (1, 13): 
    minmonthlypayment = monthlyPaymentRate*balance
    unpaidAmount = balance - minmonthlypayment
    interest = (annualInterestRate/12)*unpaidAmount
    balance = unpaidAmount + interest
print ("Remaining balance: " + str(round(balance, 2)))
